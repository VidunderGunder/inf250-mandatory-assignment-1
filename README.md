In this exercise you will write a python-program that reads an image and makes a threshold using the [Otsu algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method).

You will use [this skeleton program](https://nmbu.instructure.com/courses/5600/files/1019649/download) in Python. It consists of one function making a histogram, one that carries out the Outsu thresholding and one function that uses this to make a binary image.

You will hand in the python code on Canvas.
